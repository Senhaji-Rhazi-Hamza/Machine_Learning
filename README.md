# Machine Learning Algorithms
This project is about re-implementing some Machine Learning Algorithms and dimensionality reduction
Classifiers : 
-Bayesian Classifiers
-Expectation Maximisation 
-Gaussian Mixture Models
-Decision Tree
-Support vector Machine

Dimensionality reduction:
-PCA
-LDA
-KernelPCA
-KerbelLDA

## Classifiers (supervised Learning)
-We tend to recognize handwritten digits using classifiers in Minst Database
-We tend to classify mushrooms if they are poisonous or not according to their attribute, in mushrooms database
# How to use

## Bayesian Classifiers
-Go to the folder Classifiers and execute 'python performance.py'

### Environement Requirement for other test 
-(sudo) pip3 install jupyter
## Others Classifiers
-Go to the folder Classifiers and tap the command "jupyter notebook"
-open the [classifier].ipynb, exec cells
## Reduction Dimensionality test 
-Go to the folder reduction, tap the command "jupyter notebook"
-open [reduction].ipynb
