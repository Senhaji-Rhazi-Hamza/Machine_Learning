# Machine Learning Algorithms
This project is about re-implementing some Machine Learning Algorithms and dimensionality reduction
Classifiers : 

* Bayesian Classifiers
* Decision Tree
* Expectation Maximisation 
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Support vector Machine

Dimensionality reduction:
* PCA
* LDA
* kernel PCA comparaison with scikitLearn


## Classifiers (supervised Learning)
-We tend to recognize handwritten digits using classifiers in Minst Database
-We tend to classify mushrooms if they are poisonous or not according to their attribute, in mushrooms database
# How to use

## Bayesian Classifiers
-Go to the folder Classifiers and execute 'python performance.py'
## Decision Tree 
-open the notebook 
### Environement Requirement for other test 
-(sudo) pip3 install jupyter

## Reduction Dimensionality test 
-Go to the folder reduction, tap the command "jupyter notebook"
-open [reduction].ipynb
